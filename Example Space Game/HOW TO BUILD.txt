This folder contains base code the team can use to create their game.
To build this project you need to install CMake and the Vulkan SDK.
You are not required to use Vulkan but the base renderer does use it.

Software: 
https://CMake.org 
https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/

After installing reboot your machine and run: "cmake -S ./ -B ./build"
in a command prompt located in this folder. The .sln will be in the build folder.

One your team has settled on a name you should replace all references to Example Space Game.
The main place to do this is in the CMakeLists.txt file, but should also be done in the code.
